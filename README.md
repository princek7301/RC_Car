# RC Car

A hands-on, fast-paced project by @the.grey.shadow (Prince Kumar) and @shashank_7319 under the **Robotics and Electronics Club (REC), IIIT Bhagalpur**. The challenge was to design, build, and refine a working RC car in just 7 daysâ€”starting from scratch and ending with a fully functional prototype.

## Timeline Breakdown

### Day 1: First Steps & Soldering
- Designed the RC car circuit using **Tinkercad**.
- First-time **soldering** experience with Arduino Nano.
- Faced multiple beginner mistakes but gained valuable insights.

### Day 2: Assembly & Chassis Design
- Assembled initial parts of the car.
- Designed the chassis layout.
- Started coding and testing logic.
- Video was shot by @the.grey.shadow.

### Day 3: Chassis Cutting
- Measured and **cut the chassis** material to match the layout.
- Focused on durability, size compatibility, and weight distribution.

### Day 4: Electronics Testing & Steering Design
- Tested connections, modules, and power supply.
- Designed a basic **steering mechanism** for better mobility.

### Day 5: Mounting Components
- Placed and secured all major components on the chassis:
  - Arduino Nano
  - NRF24L01+PA+LNA
  - Joysticks
  - Li-ion Battery
  - Motor Driver
- Optimized space and wire management.

### Day 6: Final Assembly
- Completed final **assembly** of the RC car.
- Ensured everything was wired and functioning correctly.

### Day 7: Testing & Refinement
- Performed full system testing.
- Refined the design for improved performance and stability.
- The car was successfully completed!
